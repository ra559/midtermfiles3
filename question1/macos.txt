macOS (/ˌmækoʊˈɛs/;[8] previously Mac OS X and later OS X) is a Unix operating system[9] developed and marketed by Apple Inc. since 2001. It is the primary operating system for Apple's Mac computers. Within the market of desktop and laptop computers it is the second most widely used desktop OS, after Microsoft Windows and ahead of Chrome OS.

macOS succeeded the classic Mac OS, a Macintosh operating system with nine releases from 1984 to 1999. During this time, Apple cofounder Steve Jobs had left Apple and started another company, NeXT, developing the NeXTSTEP platform that would later be acquired by Apple to form the basis of macOS.

The first desktop version, Mac OS X 10.0, was released in March 2001, with its first update, 10.1, arriving later that year. All releases from Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard[10] and after are UNIX 03 certified,[11] with an exception for OS X 10.7 Lion.[12] Apple's mobile operating system, iOS, has been considered a variant of macOS.[13]
